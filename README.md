# nest-hexa-services

This package is designed to automate the process of creating and configuring architectures for your NestJS backend, based on the [hexa-mod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexa-mod) package.

It consists of 2 parts that define whether the project will be Monolithic or Microservice. In turn, it is divided into 2 parts, which are the following:

## Architecture distribution

In this part, two important points are defined, which you can choose whether to use "Architecture under Layers" or "Hexagonal Architecture"

1. Layered Architecture

The layered architecture is the typical one we have organized by default: Controllers, services, repositories, dtos.

2. Hexagonal Architecture

The hexagonal architecture is a little more specific in that it entails each module having a specific function in their respective folders: Application, Domain and Infrastructure.

## MicroServices

In this part it allows us to create microservices with nestjs in addition to being able to 2 types of configurations, the microservice itself and the Api Gateway.

And finally, you can choose the transport medium in which the microservices will communicate, which are TCP or NATS.

```
